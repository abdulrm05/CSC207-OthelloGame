# CSC207-OthelloGame
This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Othello (Reversi) board game written in Java that was done in my Software Design class CSC207. It includes support for multiple player types, game logic, and strategy-based AI players.

Features:
- Fully functional 8×8 Othello board

- Valid move checking and automatic disc flipping

- Turn-based play between:

- 🧑 Human player

- 🎲 Random player (chooses random valid moves)

- 🧠 Strategy player (chooses moves based on simple heuristics)

- Handles end-of-game detection and score calculation

- Easily extendable — you can add your own player strategy
